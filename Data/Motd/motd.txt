                          Hail Everyone

Please, all players who have tamers and would like to beta test our new Evolution pets, Page in and ask for john. 

( These pets are for testing only, they will be removed after this testing phase is completed. )



Evo system Mechanics are as follows:

Properly training your evo is a must at stage 1, once you train it to level 2 the stats will not train any longer. 
If you do not max out your stats before Stage 2, your pet will be weaker than others. 

In reference to the stats, When the evos are hatched, the stats will be random. (Str, Dex, Int) 
Ex; Str 70 - 100. With 70 being the minimum and 100 being the maximum for each stat. 
This is the method for each stat. 

Now that you know how the stats are randomly given, your pet will come with 50% of that stat.

Ex 1 : If your pet has a stat (ex:INT) at 70, it will begin around 35. Meaning 35/70 This holds true for each stat. 

Ex 2 : if your pet has a Perfect Stat which is 100, your pets will hatched with a stat of 50/100 and you would need to train it to 100 before stage 2. 

Your Evo's Stat's can only be trained to it maximum in stage 1, once your pet evolves to stage 2 ,your Evoultion Pet stats are frozen and can no longer be trained.
